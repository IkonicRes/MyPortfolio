            <p id="about"> My name is Michael, and I like to stay busy. I like to make things I'm proud of and others enjoy. In 2021 I partnered with a friend to make video games, and have experience with all elements of the game development workflow. I have studied computer science and Python, and know how to make offline applications as well as some light machine learning. Additionally, I know JavaScript, React, C++, CSS, API, Server-side API, Node.js, some C#, and a few more languages. I know HTML5 and on an unrelated note am a PC Repair Technician III Certified by Dell, Lenovo, and HP. In October of 2023, I will recieve my full-stack web development certificate from the University of Minnesota. I love to challenge myself and have a passion for problem-solving. I would go on more about myself but if you'd like to know more or need some help programming, designing, or debugging a website or application, I'm your guy! Check out the work I have done (a couple with other talented like-minds) and feel free to contact me with the contact section on the bottom of the page if you need something handled. </p>
